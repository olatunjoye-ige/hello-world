# hello-world
Hello,

This Olatunjoye Ige Emmanuel from Nigeria.
I studied English Language and have been teaching for the past seven years now.
I have always wonder how softwares are built or written whichever is used.
and I have always wanted to come up with my own app for the learners a teach.
My favourite qoute is, civility costs your nothing but buys everything.
